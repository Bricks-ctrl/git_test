    <h1>Development Log</h1>
    <p><strong><em>The Odin Project</em></strong> is an open source software development guide; a beginners bible and path to proficiency. I started <strong><em> The Odin Project</em></strong> only a few days ago and I'm already being asked to create a blog (all be it an empty one) in HTML. This is what you see before you; to make it worth my time I decided to create a personal (web development) development log. Utilising the skills and tools taught in the course this page should serve as both progression report and evidence simultaneously.</p>

    <p>An introduction to HTML quickly turned into creating this page with added focus on utilising strong, em, p & h1-6 tags. </p>
